Halo 3 has large number of armor variants available to customize your character's look in Multiplayer games. Individual pieces of each armor variant can be mixed with pieces of other armor variants to give the you a truly unique look on the battlefield (though obviously you can't mix Spartan and Elite armor pieces).<br />
<br />
Most of these armor variants first need to be unlocked before they can be used, although 2 Spartan and 2 Elite armor variants are unlocked by default. Pieces of armor variants can be unlocked by unlocking certain achievements in the game or doing certain things while playing the game, such as completing the campaign on the different difficulties or finding the skulls.<br />

I have created a <a href="armor-generator/">Halo 3 Armor Generator</a> that lets you pick the armor pieces and colors that you want, and then it generates a picture of the armor you picked, along with how to unlock the separate armor pieces. It also shows the development and history of each of the armor variants.<br />
<br />
I have also created a handy <a href="emblem-generator/">Halo 3 Emblem Generator</a> that lets you pick the icon, background and colors that you want, and then it generates a picture of the emblem you picked.
