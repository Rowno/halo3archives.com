The Terminals in Halo 3 are Forrunner computers that are shaped like giant eye balls and can be found throughout the Forrunner based levels of the game. When a player accesses a terminal, a screen appears with part of a story about two Forrunners during the time just before the Halo rings were fired and the Forrunners were fighting to stop the Flood. A bit of this story is found in each of the 7 terminals throughout the game.<br />
<br />
The terminals can be found and accessed on any difficulty in the game. To unlock the Marathon Man achievement, you have to wait or go through each terminal until <strong>AFTER</strong> the alarm goes off, the screen turns red and you get redirected within the terminal (the redirection occurs automatically after a certain amount of time). You do not have to access the terminals in any order and you don't have to access them all in the same game session.<br />
