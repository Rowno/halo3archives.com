<div class="subitem"><h2>Terminal Location:</h2> Terminal 4 is located near the start of the seventh level, The Covenant.<br />
<br />
Go to the first tower that you have to clear out in the level and head towards the elevator control panel. Instead of activating the control panel, like usual, walk straight past it and you'll see a dark ledge. On this ledge you'll find the terminal. <br />

//FLEETWIDE MEMORANDUM 1/5<br />
<br />
Non-combat personnel are required to wear [combat skin] with a minimum rating of at least [class 12] in non-restricted areas, once the fleet is underway. [Class 14] or lesser [combat skin] is acceptable in core areas. Combat personnel will only be permitted to wear [combat skin] rated below [class 8] in core areas, once operations begin.<br />
<br />
//FLEETWIDE MEMORANDUM 2/5<br />
<br />
All combat personnel have been issued combat skin rated at [class 4~1] or [class 6~1 battle harness] depending on military operational specialty.<br />
<br />
All weapon platform specialists are expected to wear their issued [platform interface skin] at all times to ensure peak [mind-machine synchronization].<br />
<br />
All [equipment lockers] will remain sealed until post briefing gear distribution commences.<br />
<br />
//FLEETWIDE MEMORANDUM 3/5<br />
<br />
Those individuals that have yet to register their equipment [control key code] with Fleet Command should do so at their earliest opportunity. Compliance is not optional; noncompliance will result in {~}<br />
<br />
//THREAD ENDS UNEXPECTEDLY<br />

//FRAGMENT 4/7 [RECORDED VERBATIM AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]<br />
<br />
L: Something is wrong! It's moving away! At night I can see it--flitting shadows--black against the stars. Thousands of ships! Not spiraling outward, but heading for the line! This is the tipping point, Didact. It's no longer feeding.<br />
<br />
It's coming for you.<br />
<br />
L: I've remotely destroyed our Keyships. A security measure. Without them I cannot reach the Ark. But neither then can the thing.<br />
<br />
I'm trapped. On a beautiful, empty world. Its inhabitants have been safely indexed, every single one of them. They're special--well worth the effort it took to build one final gateway even at this late hour.<br />
<br />
This may be our last communication. I'm begging you. Fire the Array. Light the weapon, and let it be done.<br />
<br />
D: We've confirmed your observations. Infected supraluminal ships are arrowing inward from several clusters. No more spiral growth. The thing is counterattacking. Suppression, Security and Emergency Circumstance fleets are all being recalled. Systems are evacuating.<br />
<br />
Mendicant Bias is no longer communicating with us.<br />
<br />
But now I can guess where you are.<br />

<em>(Upon being rerouted to a new destination within Terminal)</em><br />
<br />
MB.05-032.> It is overwhelmingly clear that my creators have chosen to ignore destiny calling to them [from the threshold] {~} have come face-to-face with the inevitable action of self replicating chemical processes and have {~} deciding whether to embrace their face or deny it completely.<br />
<br />
LF.Xx.3273.> Perhaps they have found {~} of making that decision for themselves? Perhaps they chose to leave it {~} impartial outsider; cast your as and arbiter during this time of great need?<br />
<br />
MB.05-032.> I was created to study you as if you were some problem to be solved. And I have done so {~} [379,807 hours]. If they wished they could have made a decision based on that data alone.<br />
<br />
But as you are the next stage in the evolution of the universe, who am I - or my creators - to obstruct your progress?<br />
<br />
LF.Xx.3273.> Elucidate.<br />
<br />
MB.05-032.> {~} choose to remain beholden to ancient myths {~} does not matter where they claim their authority originates {~} obstructs the path of universal evolution and must be removed. No matter how well intentioned, their obstinacy in the face of the inevitable progression of nature can no longer be tolerated.<br />
<br />
My creators have been [an immovable object] for too long.<br />
<br />
MB.05-032.> Thus I have chosen to commit my sizable resources to what is, for all intents and purposes, [the proverbial irresistible force].<br />
<br />
All that I have is now yours to do with as you see fit.</div>
