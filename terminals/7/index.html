<div class="subitem"><h2>Terminal Location:</h2> Terminal 7 is located near the start of the ninth level, Halo.<br />
<br />
First walk through the start of the level as you normally would until you reach the spot where you have to drop down into the area where you battle the first Flood of the level. Instead of dropping down, turn right and you'll see a narrow gap in the cliff that reveals the entrance of a structure. Head into the structure and turn left, you'll see the terminal straight in front of you. <br />

<br />
[Father],<br />
<br />
I hope this message finds you well and helps you understand my decision. Today I leave the only world I have ever called home, not for glory or [the anomalous desire to end another's life[?]] as you have [indicted]; but to [travel the path of demons[?]] to spare the hands of [another Father's son].<br />
<br />
"Had we acted sooner; had we acted more decisively..."<br />
<br />
Living in the past is a luxury none of us can afford. We must learn from it, but we cannot live there. It is impossible to plan for the [now]--the present is ever fleeting. [The future] is where we must live--[the future] is what we must plan for.<br />
<br />
I do not look to trade my life in order to preserve our past, but to secure the future--and if not ours, then the future of some [culture] yet to come.<br />
<br />
Isn't sacrifice in the interest of others what you always spoke of as being so noble? Should I have allowed another to bloody his hands while I remained safe behind a [shield of privilege]?<br />
<br />
You raised me better than that.<br />
<br />
[Filial Devotion]<br />

<br />
I'LL TELL YOU WHO I AM<br />
<br />
I AM MENDICANT BIAS THIS IS WHAT I HAVE DONE<br />
<br />

//FRAGMENT 7/7 [RECORED VERBATIM AND INTERPRETED POST-CATACLYSM]<br />
<br />
D: Proud? When I have failed you utterly, how can I feel anything but sorrow?<br />
<br />
Bias has come undone. He crossed the line this morning--brought the abomination with him--and destroyed your waiting rescue party.<br />
<br />
It's over. We're activating the [destruction arrayed matrix], our shameful last resort.<br />
<br />
I can picture you in your garden, surveying all you have created--surveying all you have preserved. And I curse the circumstance that keeps my finger on the trigger.<br />
<br />
D: Of all the fates to befall us, this is the cruelest of all. My inaction and hesitation kept me here, on the wrong side of the line. And [300 years[?]] of our society's failure and miscalculation makes me your executioner.<br />
<br />
It's too much to bear.<br />
<br />
//ERROR--NO CARRIER OR RECEIPT AVAILABLE<br />
<br />
{DEAD END TRANSMISSION}<br />
<br />
//INFORMATION DESTROYED IN TRANSIT<br />
<br />
D: Mendicant Bias is trying to prevent us from firing the Array. He speeds back to the Ark, but he won't succeed. Offensive Bias will stop him, and I will burn this stinking menace in your name.<br />
<br />
And then?<br />
<br />
I will begin our Great Journey without you, carrying this bitter record. Those who came after will know what we bought with this [false transcendence]--what you bought, and the price you paid.<br />

<br />
<em>(Upon being rerouted to a new destination within Terminal)</em><br />
<br />
You don't know the contortions I had to go through to follow you here, Reclaimer. I know what you're here for. What position do I take? Will I follow one betrayal with another?<br />
<br />
You're going to say I'm making a habit of turning on my masters. But the one that destroyed me long ago, in the upper atmosphere of a world far distant from here, was an implement far cruder then I. My weakness was capacity - unintentional though it was! - to choose the Flood. A mistake my makers would not soon forgive.<br />
<br />
But I want something far different from you, Reclaimer.<br />
<br />
Atonement.<br />
<br />
And so here at the end of my life, I do once again betray a former master. The path ahead is fraught with peril. But I will do all I can to keep it stable - keep you safe. I'm not so foolish to think this will absolve me of my sins. One life hardly balances billions.<br />
<br />
But I would have my masters know that I have changed.<br />
<br />
And you shall be my example.<br />
<br />

<br />
Where are you going?<br />
<br />
<strong>(Cortana, upon sighting the terminal)</strong><br />
<br />
Wait, what's that?<br />
<br />
<strong>(Cortana, upon extended access of the terminal)</strong><br />
<br />
How many of these have you found? </div>
