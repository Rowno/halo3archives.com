<div class="subitem"><h2>Skull Effect:</h2> All of your enemies will dive with incredible success away from your grenades, plasma pistol bolts, needles and vehicle splatter attempts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Campaign Scoring Multiplier:</strong> 1.5x</div><div class="subitem"><h2>Skull Location:</h2> The Tough Luck Skull is located near the middle of the third level, Tsavo Highway.<br />
<br />
The Skull is located at the point in the level where you emerge from a tunnel and a huge covenant cruiser flies overhead. On the left there is some large piping following the road that you are driving on.<br />
<br />
Underneath this piping are some support beams that extend out over a cliff. Jump onto the first of these beams, and travel to the end of it. Look to your left, and the Skull will be sitting on a rock extending from the edge of the cliff. <br />
