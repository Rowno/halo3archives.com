<div class="subitem"><h2>Skull Effect:</h2> When enemies drop their weapons, they will have considerably less ammo in them.<br />

<strong>Campaign Scoring Multiplier:</strong> 2x</div><div class="subitem"><h2>Skull Location:</h2> The Famine Skull is located near the middle of the sixth level, The Ark.<br />
<br />
The Skull is located near the point where the path you follow branches off into two sections (one leading to the area where you need to let the tanks across the bridge, and the other leading towards the area where you meet up with the frigate).<br />
<br />
Take the right path, as you would if you were completing the mission, and youâ€™ll notice a structure above you to the left (above the area where you encounter a few ghosts). You need to scale the rocks to the right of the structure to get onto it (or you can scale the rocks under the structure), and then travel across it so that you pass 3 of the large support beams extending into the cliffs. Inside of the fourth support beam, lies the Skull.<br />
<br />
A well pulled off grenade jump should get you up onto the beam. Another (probably easier) way to get on to the beam is to deploy a Deployable Cover on the edge of the platform just under the beam and then jumping off the Deployable Cover to get onto the beam. <br />
