<strong>Campaign Scoring Multiplier:</strong> None</div><div class="subitem"><h2>Skull Location:</h2> The Sandbox Skull is located on the map Sandbox which is part of the Mythic map pack.<br />
<br />
It is located next to the big dune behind Red base at the very edge of the map, right in front of the Forerunner wall. The hard part is getting to skull alive due to the lasers. The easiest way to get to it is to download one of the many <a href="https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=halo+3+sandbox+blocked+lasers">map variants</a> that have the lasers blocked off or to overload the map (and lasers) by using infinitely respawning Tripmines. But if you want a challenge and get the skull by yourself with the lasers active, one way is to build a tunnel to the skull using Tube pieces.<br />
