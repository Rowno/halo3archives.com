<br />
After you encounter the first enemy in the game (the Gold Armored Brute), two enemy drop ships will appear a bit further down the stream. Go towards the drop ship that is furthest away, and stay on the right side of the stream. Continue along the right (towards the cliff edge), and you will find a rock that juts out a bit over the large lake. The Skull is located on this rock.<br />
